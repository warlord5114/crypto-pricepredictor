# ü™ô Crypto Price Predictor

This project predicts the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using machine learning. Unlike basic models, it uses an **ensemble stacking approach** combining multiple regression algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.

## üîç Project Overview

Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile, making reliable prediction a challenging yet valuable task. This project analyzes historical price data (from `crypto.csv` or a database) to learn patterns and forecast future prices.

The ensemble model leverages diverse regressors and intelligently combines their strengths to provide better forecasts than single-model approaches.

## üß∞ Features & Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   Reads historical price data (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from CSV or SQLite database.

2. **Data Preparation**
   Cleans data, fills missing values, and creates lagged or derived features for better learning.

3. **Feature Scaling**
   Applies standard scaling to features, crucial for models like SVR and KNN.

4. **Time-Series Train-Test Split**
   Respects the chronological order of data to avoid data leakage and simulate real-world forecasting.

5. **Base Models Used**

   * Linear Regression
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
   * K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)

6. **Stacking Ensemble**
   Uses `StackingRegressor` to combine base models and trains a meta-model (Random Forest) to optimally blend predictions.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   Prints R¬≤ scores for each individual model and the ensemble model.

8. **Prediction & Visualization**
   Predicts future prices and visualizes true vs predicted prices on the test set for easy interpretation.

9. **Synthetic Data Fallback**
   If insufficient real data is present, generates synthetic dummy data for testing and development.

## üß† Why Ensemble Stacking?

* **Combines multiple algorithms** to capture different aspects of price behavior.
* **Reduces overfitting** and improves robustness compared to single models.
* Learns **optimal weights** for combining predictions rather than simple averaging.
* Scaling and time-aware splitting further enhance model reliability.

## üìà How to Improve Further

* Add more complex time-series models like LSTM or Prophet.
* Incorporate additional features: trading volume trends, social sentiment, macroeconomic indicators.
* Deploy the model as a real-time prediction service or dashboard.
* Tune hyperparameters with automated search methods (GridSearch, RandomSearch).
